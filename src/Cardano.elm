# Transaction Building Overview

This framework aims to provide intuitive and correct building blocks
for transaction building, based on the following aspects of transactions.

1.  Intent: what we want to achieve with this transaction
      - Transfer: send some tokens from somewhere to somewhere else
      - Mint and burn: create and destroy tokens
      - Use a script: provide/spend tokens and data to/from a script
      - Stake management: collect rewards, manage delegations and pool registrations
      - Voting: vote on proposals
      - Propose: make your own proposals
2.  Metadata: additional information
3.  Constraints: what additional constraints do we want to set
      - Temporal validity range: first/last slots when the Tx is valid
4.  Requirements: what is imposed by the protocol
      - Tx fee: depends on size/mem/cpu
      - Hashes: for metadata and script data
      - Collateral: for plutus scripts
      - Signatures: for consuming inputs and scripts requirements

This API revolves around composing intents, then adding metadata and constraints,
and finally trying to validate it and auto-populate all requirements.
That’s enough theory, let’s get more concrete.

Let’s first define some addresses we are going to be using.

    addressFromHex addressHexString =
        Cardano.Address.fromBytes addressHexString
            |> Maybe.withDefault shouldNotErrorIfIsACorrectAddress

    ( me, you, someone ) =
        ( addressFromHex "01..."
        , addressFromHex "01..."
        , addressFromHex "01..."
        )

Here is a simple way to send 1 Ada to someone else.

    -- 1 Ada is 1000000 Lovelaces
    -- Asset amounts are typed with unbounded Natural numbers
    oneAda =
        Value.onlyLovelace (Natural.fromSafeString "1000000")

    -- We need to provide available UTxOs for Tx finalization.
    -- For this simple Tx, it only needs to know of our own UTxOs,
    -- that we would typically retrieve via an API provider.
    localStateUtxos =
        Utxo.refDictFromList myUtxos

    sendOneAdaToSomeoneTx =
        [ Spend (FromWallet me oneAda), SendTo someone oneAda ]
            |> finalize localStateUtxos []

The finalization step validates the Tx, compute the fees and add other required fields.

More control on the transfer is possible if we want to have multiple senders and receivers.
Here is an example where me and you both contribute 1 Ada.

    twoAda =
        Value.add oneAda oneAda

    localStateUtxos =
        Utxo.refDictFromList (myUtxos ++ yourUtxos)

    bothSendOneAdaToSomeoneTx =
        [ Spend (FromWallet me oneAda)
        , Spend (FromWallet you oneAda)
        , SendTo someone twoAda
        ]
            |> finalize localStateUtxos []

To mint or burn via a native script, here is what we can do.

    ( dogScriptRef, dogPolicyId, dogAssetName ) =
        Debug.todo "dog info is provided"

    ( catScriptRef, catPolicyId, catAssetName ) =
        Debug.todo "cat info is provided"

    localStateUtxos =
        Utxo.refDictFromList (myUtxos ++ scriptsRefsUtxos)

    mintAndBurnTx =
        -- minting 1 dog
        -- Mint amounts are of type Integer: unbounded positive or negative integers
        [ MintBurn
            { policyId = dogPolicyId
            , assets = Map.singleton dogAssetName Integer.one
            , scriptWitness = NativeWitness (WitnessReference dogScriptRef)
            }
        , SendTo me (Value.onlyToken dogPolicyId dogAssetName Natural.one)

        -- burning 1 cat
        , Spend <| FromWallet me (Value.onlyToken catPolicyId catAssetName Natural.one)
        , MintBurn
            { policyId = catPolicyId
            , assets = Map.singleton catAssetName Integer.negativeOne
            , scriptWitness = NativeWitness (WitnessReference catScriptRef)
            }
        ]
            |> finalize localStateUtxos []

Let’s show how to use a native script to lock some tokens,
that can only be retrieved with our signature.

    -- Retrieve my public key credential from my address
    myKeyCred =
        Address.extractPubKeyHash me
            |> Maybe.withDefault dummyCredential

    -- Native script to lock funds with our public key
    lockScript =
        ScriptPubkey myKeyCred

    lockScriptHash =
        -- TODO: Script.hash
        Script.hash (Script.Native lockScript)

    -- Deriving the script address from the script hash
    scriptAddress =
        Address.Shelley
            { networkId = Mainnet
            , paymentCredential = ScriptHash lockScriptHash

            -- Adding our stake credential while we are at it
            -- so that our ada stays staked and yields staking rewards
            , stakeCredential = Address.extractStakeCredential me
            }

    localStateUtxos =
        Utxo.refDictFromList myUtxos

    nativeLockTx =
        [ Spend (FromWallet me twoAda), SendTo scriptAddress twoAda ]
            |> finalize localStateUtxos []

As you can see, we could even keep our stake credential
while locking our ada into the script address.
It means the locked ada will still be counted in our stake for the rewards.
This is thanks to Cardano addresses which have two parts.
The script logic only determines the first part of the address.

Let’s show an example how to spend utxos from this native script.
We want to retrieve 1 ada from it, and keep the other ada locked.
We need to do that in two actions.

1.  Spend the whole UTxO, with its 2 ada in it.
2.  Send 1 ada back to the same address.

We cannot partially spend UTxOs.
UTxOs are like bills, you spend them whole and get change for overspending.

    ( lockedUtxoRef, lockedOutput ) =
        -- TODO: Transaction.findOutputUtxosAt
        Transaction.findOutputUtxosAt scriptAddress nativeLockTx
            |> List.head

    { updatedState } =
        Cardano.updateLocalState txId nativeLockTx localStateUtxos

    nativeUnlockTx =
        [ Spend <|
            FromNativeScript
                -- spend the whole UTxO
                { spentInput = lockedUtxoRef

                -- This native script is so small,
                -- the easiest way to provide it is directly by value instead of by reference
                , nativeScriptWitness = WitnessValue lockScript
                }

        -- Retrieve 1 ada and send 1 ada back to the contract
        , SendTo me oneAda
        , SendTo scriptAddress oneAda
        ]
            |> finalize updatedState []

Alright, how about doing all those things with Plutus scripts now?
Plutus scripts can be used for many purposes such as minting,
spending funds or withdrawing staking rewards.

All script executions need to provide a "redeemer".
This is some mandatory piece of data provided as argument to the script function.
Transaction signatures required by the script must also be specified in a dedicated field.
This enables very efficient script executions since they can just check
that a public key is present in that `requiredSigners` field.

Let’s start with a simple minting and burning example.
For this example, we suppose the Plutus script was already written,
in some onchain language, like [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/).
This Plutus script will accept any mint or burn
as long as we present our signature in the transaction.
The redeemer is not used at all so we can define a dummy one,
of the smallest size possible since a redeemer is mandatory.

    ( dogScriptOutputRef, dogPolicyId, dogAssetName ) =
        Debug.todo "dog info is provided"

    ( catScriptOutputRef, catPolicyId, catAssetName ) =
        Debug.todo "cat info is provided"

    myKeyCred =
        Address.extractPubKeyHash me
            |> Maybe.withDefault dummyCredential

    -- Dummy redeemer of the smallest size possible.
    -- A redeemer is mandatory, but unchecked by this contract anyway.
    dummyRedeemer =
        Data.Int Integer.zero

    localStateUtxos =
        Utxo.refDictFromList (myUtxos ++ scriptsRefsUtxos)

    mintAndBurnTx =
        -- minting 1 dog
        [ MintBurn
            { policyId = dogPolicyId
            , assets = Map.singleton dogAssetName Integer.one
            , scriptWitness =
                PlutusWitness
                    { script = WitnessReference dogScriptOutputRef
                    , redeemerData = \_ -> dummyRedeemer
                    , requiredSigners = [ myKeyCred ]
                    }
            }
        , SendTo me (Value.onlyToken dogPolicyId dogAssetName Natural.one)

        -- burning 1 cat
        , Spend <| FromWallet me (Value.onlyToken catPolicyId catAssetName Natural.one)
        , MintBurn
            { policyId = catPolicyId
            , assets = Map.singleton catAssetName Integer.negativeOne
            , scriptWitness =
                PlutusWitness
                    { script = WitnessReference catScriptOutputRef
                    , redeemerData = \_ -> dummyRedeemer
                    , requiredSigners = [ myKeyCred ]
                    }
            }
        ]
            |> finalize localStateUtxos []

You may have noticed that `redeemerData` is taking a function instead of just a redeemer.
This is to enable more advanced use cases such as [UTxO indexers][utxo-indexers].
But for simple use cases, we can just ignore that argument with an underscore `_`.

[utxo-indexers]: https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/aiken-design-patterns

Ok now let’s show how sending to a Plutus script would be done.
As before, we’ll use the simple example of a lock script.
But this time, we don’t write it directly (as in the NativeScript example).
Instead we suppose the script was written in some onchain language (Aiken, Opshin, Plutus Tx, ...),
and the blueprint of the script is available, with its hash.

In the eUTxO model, UTxOs sent to a script address must have a piece of data attached.
That piece of data is referred to as the "datum".
It will be passed as argument to the script execution
when some future transaction try to spend that UTxO later.

    lockScriptHash =
        extractedFromBlueprint

    -- A script address is directly tied to the script hash
    -- and so indirectly also tied to the (immutable) script code.
    scriptAddress =
        Address.Shelley
            { networkId = Mainnet
            , paymentCredential = ScriptHash lockScriptHash
            , stakeCredential = Address.extractStakeCredential me
            }

    myKeyCred =
        Address.extractPubKeyHash me
            |> Maybe.withDefault dummyCredential

    -- Put the unlocking pubkey hash in the datum of the funds we lock
    datumWithKeyCred =
        Data.Bytes (Bytes.toAny myKeyCred)

    localStateUtxos =
        Utxo.refDictFromList (myUtxos ++ scriptsRefsUtxos)

    lockInPlutusScriptTx =
        [ Spend (FromWallet me fourAda)
        , SendToOutput
            { address = scriptAddress
            , amount = fourAda
            , datumOption = Just (Datum datumWithKeyCred)
            , referenceScript = Nothing
            }
        ]
            |> finalize localStateUtxos []

Now that we know how to send values to a script, let’s see how to collect them.
We will show how to retrieve 2 ada from the previously locked 4 ada.
For that, we need to do a few things:

1.  Spend the whole UTxO, with its 4 ada in it.
    We cannot partially spend UTxOs.
    UTxOs are like bills, you spend them whole and get change for overspending.
2.  Provide the script code to the transaction.
    The script hash must match with the first part of the UTxO address we are spending.
3.  Provide our signature for the proof that the script needs.
4.  Retrieve 2 ada from that spent UTxO, and send 2 ada back to the same script.

For such a tiny script, which just checks if our signature is present,
no need to put it in a reference UTxO first.
We can embed it directly in the transaction witness.

    ( lockedUtxoRef, lockedOutput ) =
        -- TODO: Transaction.findOutputUtxosAt
        Transaction.findOutputUtxosAt scriptAddress lockInPlutusScriptTx
            |> List.head

    { updatedState } =
        Cardano.updateLocalState txId lockInPlutusScriptTx localStateUtxos

    lockScript =
        extractedFromTheBlueprint

    unlockFromPlutusScriptTx =
        -- Collect the locked UTxO at the script address
        [ Spend <|
            FromPlutusScript
                { spentInput = lockedUtxoRef
                , datumWitness = Nothing -- not needed, the datum was given by value
                , plutusScriptWitness =
                    { script = ( lockScript.version, WitnessValue lockScript.script )
                    , redeemerData = \_ -> dummyRedeemer -- unused
                    , requiredSigners = [ myKeyCred ]
                    }
                }
        , SendTo me twoAda

        -- Return the other 2 ada to the lock script (there was 4 ada initially)
        , SendToOutput
            { address = scriptAddress
            , amount = twoAda
            , datumOption = Just (Datum datumWithKeyCred)
            , referenceScript = Nothing
            }
        ]
            |> finalize updatedState []

But scripts duplicates in different inputs are counted multiple times.
Both native and Plutus scripts are counted.
One issue here is I don’t think we still have the original bytes representation of these.
